smbclient usage most on windows 

how to find a host

                                                                      -- smbclient -L ip

                                                                      -- smbclient -N -L \\\\{TARGET_IP}\\

try and error with the hosts , mostly admin with uses

                                                                      -- smbclient \\\\ip\\Admin$ (as example)

mostly get errors , but maybe a free work shares are vulnerable

moving in smbclient when connected like linux (ls cd get)

maybe more to come
